## Demonstration of elastic search in golang:

Elasticsearch is a powerful, open-source search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene. It enables real-time search, data analysis, and visualization, making it ideal for large volumes of data. Designed for scalability, speed, and ease of use, Elasticsearch supports full-text search, structured search, and complex queries. It is widely used for log and event data analysis, monitoring, and operational intelligence. Elasticsearch integrates seamlessly with the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), offering a complete solution for data ingestion, processing, and visualization. Its distributed nature allows for horizontal scaling, ensuring high availability and reliability across various applications and industries.
